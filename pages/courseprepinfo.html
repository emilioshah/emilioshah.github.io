                        It is highly advisable that you drive a car with 4×4 or AWD when coming to one of our courses. The County Road at times can be very rough and while we usually don’t have mud to get stuck in, there can be a substantial amount of snow or water on the road. Please fill up your car with gas before leaving town. The closest gas stations are
                        located 1 exit south on I-25 and in Clines Corners.

                        Phone and internet reception are limited and spotty in the area. Please be prepared to drive a mile or more to find coverage.

                        All of our courses feature long walks and a
                        substantial amount of time on your feet. The terrain is very rugged and
                        at times can seem daunting. Please wear comfortable, durable and
                        protective footwear.
